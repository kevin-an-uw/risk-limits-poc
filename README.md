# Stock-Trading-Limit-Monitoring
This project is to build a Proof of Concept (POC) of trading limit monitoring work-flow.  In a typical financial institute, this work flow is usually used by Capital Markets middle offices to monitor Front Office trading activities and ensure trading activities are within defined limits. This is part of daily Global Risk Management operations.
